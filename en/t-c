<li>InPost may offer "unlimited" delivery services for various subscription plans. The term "unlimited" shall mean that no specific predetermined limit is imposed with regard to number of deliveries scheduled.

<li><strong>Infringement &amp; Counterfeit goods</strong></li>
<ol type="i" style="text-transform: none;">
<li>We respect the intellectual property rights of others, and we make efforts not to publish any material that is subject to third party copyright, trademark or other legal protections. If you believe any material on the website infringes your intellectual property rights, please inform us by submitting an Infringement Complaint</li>
<li>InPost takes seriously the problems caused by Internet advertising and sale of counterfeit goods - which are also known as "knock offs", replicas, faux or fake products. Counterfeit goods are imitations of well-known brands. They are typically sold at prices lower than the genuine product, and they almost always bear what looks like the genuine product's trademark or logo. Ads for these products may or may not specify that they are replicas, and they are often difficult to distinguish from the genuine product - particularly in online ads where you don't have the chance to examine the goods themselves. While we make every effort to ensure that our service is not used for the sale of counterfeit goods, and we carefully select the merchants and products linked to our websites, we cannot guarantee that every item advertised and/or delivered through our cross-border shopping service is 100% authentic. But we do commit to investigate all problems</li>
<li>If you are the rightful owner of a trademark or other intellectual property, and you know or suspect that your rights are being infringed by the advertising of counterfeit goods on any InPost website and/or the shipment of such goods through our international delivery services, please inform us by submitting an Infringement Complaint</li>
<li>After we receive your complaint, we will conduct an investigation. If we determine that counterfeit goods infringing your rights are indeed being advertised and/or distributed through InPost, we will take appropriate action such as:</li>
<ol type="1" style="text-transform: none; font-style: italic;">
<li>removing the ad for the infringing product</li>
<li>prohibiting the merchant of the infringing product from advertising on InPost websites</li>
<li>disabling the customer's account if the customer is knowingly importing counterfeit goods using InPost services</li>
<li>notifying law enforcement authorities</li>
</ol>

<li>Parcels (where collectable) are available for collection in a given machine for 72 hours after placing them in the machines.

<li>On signing in our system, the Addressee must provide their email address, mobile phone number, registered by a Canadian cellular network, as well as their postal code.

<li><strong>Relationship between you and the seller</strong> - We have no liability for any failure of a seller to ship to your InPost Address or to fulfill your order, or for any defects in any product you purchase, or any injury or damage that any product may cause, or for any other failure of the product to meet your expectations</li>

However, we have no duty or responsibility to inspect packages for non-obvious damage or breakage, and we do not accept responsibility for the accuracy of product descriptions and other information provided by you</li>
<li>If we discover that the description of the contents of the package or other information you supply is not accurate, then, depending on the specific situation, we may request you to provide additional documentation about the contents and/or their value, or we may refuse to ship it (you will be notified), or we may correct the information</li>
