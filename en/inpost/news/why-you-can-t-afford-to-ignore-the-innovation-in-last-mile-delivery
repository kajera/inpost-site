                                                                        <div class="row">

                                    <div class="prose" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Last month I wrote a Blog about <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/1-reason-shopping-cart-abandonment-tony-jasinski?trk=mp-author-card" target="_blank"><em>The Number 1 Reason for Shopping Cart Abandonment</em></a> and if you read it, you know that the &lsquo;reason&rsquo; is directly tied to the lack of delivery options customers have when shopping online. Winning at the e-Commerce game comes down to three things; product selection, ease of site navigation / ordering, and convenience (<em>which is all about having flexible delivery options for customers</em>).</p>
<p>Traditionally, the challenge for retailers with offering timely and flexible delivery options is that mainstream shipping solutions have always been quite expensive to operate. Someone has to incur the cost of any change to the status quo: if not the retailer, then the consumer. In order to drive those costs down a commitment is needed to leveraging technology; new transport networks, and methods that will trigger the fundamental changes that everyone wants to see. The most significant delivery costs are incurred during Last Mile Delivery, which refers to the movement of products or &lsquo;goods&rsquo; from a fulfillment center to the final destination. Specifically, the last leg of your product/parcel&rsquo;s trip before it arrives on your customer&rsquo;s doorstep and that&rsquo;s the part that matters to consumers most.</p>
<p>Innovation within Last Mile Delivery is already having a significant impact on the growth of e-Commerce around the world. E-Tailers that are jumping on board and embracing new delivery options stand to not only retain their customers for years to come but will continue to grow their business by giving customers the choice as to how they receive their goods. According to Canada Post, &ldquo;'click and collect' is the fastest growing method for consumers to receive their online purchases, as 35% of Canadian households cannot safely receive daytime deliveries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was always inevitable is that Last Mile Delivery would be disrupted (due to technology and innovation) and what&rsquo;s more apparent is the level of disruption that is occurring and ongoing. Consumers want options because consumers are people and people are not sedentary - they are 24/7. We are a society on the move. With so much technology, which eases and facilitates convenience, already intersecting our lives, the thirst for ease and convenience crosses over to how and where we shop and specifically, how we take possession of the goods we&rsquo;ve purchased. The innovation that we are witnessing speaks to the democratization of the warehousing, shipping and delivery industries. &nbsp;Much of how consumers make decisions about where they buy from is purely based on the convenience of how they will receive their shipment. Think of retailers who are no longer around who didn&rsquo;t understand this trend like Borders, for example, and how they became extinct at the hands of Amazon and others. Amazon made it easy to receive your goods and up until their demise, Borders was still primarily trying to drive customers to their stores. This is highlighted by the findings of a recent study conducted by Deutsche Post DHL Group, where they found that &ldquo;online shoppers also gain satisfaction from a greater choice of delivery location as 94 percent of respondents said they were very happy when they could specify parcel lockers like DHL&rsquo;s Pack Stations as alternative delivery addresses, while one in every two said they would like the option of delivery to their trusted neighbors in their absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So having said that... Here are some of the leading innovative ways that Last Mile Delivery is already changing the way we receive everything from registered letters to gardening tools to clothing and even prepared food from our favorite restaurant. They are all paving the way forward and influencing where customers choose to buy from and we can no longer afford to ignore the innovation that is not only driving today but will become mainstream tomorrow.</p>
<p><u><strong>Parcel Locker Networks / Pick Up Centers</strong></u></p>
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width" data-imgsrc="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAgwAAAAJDFhNGE1YzY2LTRjZjMtNGFmNC1iYTIwLWMwYzEwODM4NjIyNw.jpg"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAgwAAAAJDFhNGE1YzY2LTRjZjMtNGFmNC1iYTIwLWMwYzEwODM4NjIyNw.jpg" /></div>
<p>Parcel Locker Networks are popping up everywhere. Retailers like Amazon as well as couriers like UPS use them and there are global parcel networks like <a href="http://inpost24.ca" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">InPost</a> who offer this solution in many countries. <a href="http://inpost24.ca" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Parcel Lockers</a> offer a highly convenient and reliable alternative for Last Mile Delivery. How do they work? Easy&hellip; The customer shops online and selects the Parcel Locker as their preferred delivery option and chooses a Locker location that is closest to them. Once the parcel starts the journey over to that locker, the customer is then notified by email or text and then they can check its whereabouts at any moment by tracking it online. When the parcel has been delivered to the Parcel Locker, the customer will immediately be notified by text or email and can pick up their parcel at their convenience. We are also seeing the emergence of Pick Up Centers like <a href="http://www.penguinpickup.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Penguin Pick-Up</a> by Smart Centers in Canada where they offer a free convenient pick-up center for all online purchases. They&rsquo;ve partnered with many retailers to make this available to customers who shop online. Wal-Mart is another example of a retailer encouraging their customers to shop online with their dedicated pickup stations in stores.</p>
<p><u><strong>Alternative Courier Delivery</strong></u></p>
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width" data-imgsrc="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAj2AAAAJGE2M2IxNjQ1LWQ4NzUtNGNjZC1iNzQzLTU1MDZmMjIyNWRjYg.png"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAj2AAAAJGE2M2IxNjQ1LWQ4NzUtNGNjZC1iNzQzLTU1MDZmMjIyNWRjYg.png" /></div>
<p>Yes, we are all familiar with the traditional couriers like UPS, FedEx and the National Postal Services but there are all sorts of Alternative Courier Delivery Services popping up and disrupting Last Mile Delivery, using technology to get shipments to customers more effectively. We all know about Amazon &lsquo;Prime&rsquo; and &lsquo;Prime Now&rsquo; memberships offering consumers&rsquo; same-day delivery services through their branded trucks that arrive at our door. Amazon &lsquo;Prime Now&rsquo; recently announced that they will soon be launching in Canada specifically in cities like Toronto and Vancouver following the success they&rsquo;ve seen in the US. Companies like Parcel Pal use a route optimized algorithm that enables couriers to have an average delivery time of only 1 hour so that end customers know exactly when their order will arrive. Others like Deliv already operate in 17 different markets where they bridge the Last Mile gap between e-Tailers and customers and UBER Rush uses on-demand delivery and optimizes their network of drivers to get parcels to customers quickly and cost-effectively. Furthermore, don&rsquo;t leave out the growing number of Bicycle Courier networks like <a href="http://www.foodora.ca" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Foodora</a>, <a href="http://favourdelivery.ca" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Favour</a> and <a href="http://ubereats.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">UBER Eats</a> and <a href="http://deliveroo.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Deliveroo</a> who are taking on previous disrupters like Just Eat in several markets. They are all making waves with more and more popping up all the time.</p>
<p><u><strong>Smart Car Pick Up</strong></u></p>
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width" data-imgsrc="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAgwAAAAJDhlNTgxYjNiLTBhYjgtNDA1Ny04MWJlLWI0M2U5MDMyZTBmMA.jpg"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAgwAAAAJDhlNTgxYjNiLTBhYjgtNDA1Ny04MWJlLWI0M2U5MDMyZTBmMA.jpg" /></div>
<p>A car is no longer a car; it&rsquo;s now a storage locker. A recent article in Bloomberg.com in July 2016 highlighted that &ldquo;Smart cars will become delivery boxes for Deutsche Post AG&rsquo;s DHL package operation in Germany this year in the largest test so far of the mail and auto industry working together to leverage connected cars.&rdquo; The way it works is Smart cars can arrange for DHL to deliver parcels to the trunks of customers parked cars. This initiative kicked off earlier this month in the town of Stuttgart and they look to be rolling this in the next several months to as many as seven cities across Germany. Order online and have your parcel delivered to your parked car. Why not, right? Will be interesting to see how this plays out. Keep an eye on this space.</p>

<p>Companies like Amazon are testing Last Mile Delivery by way of using Drones. They refer to it as &lsquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011&amp;ref=producthunt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon Prime Air</a>&rsquo;. According to Amazon, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a future delivery system designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using small unmanned aerial vehicles also called drones.&rdquo; The benefits? According to their website, Amazon believes that this Last Mile Delivery method has &ldquo;great potential to enhance the services we already provide to millions of customers by proving rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system.&rdquo; This will take some time before it&rsquo;s fully deployed and Amazon will need the regulatory support needed to make it happen, but it&rsquo;s well on its way.</p>
<p>I believe we have only touched the surface of what is possible with parcel delivery. Last Mile Delivery is now a key focus of innovation for eTailers and logistics companies and there is definitely more to come! Feel free to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyjasinski" target="_blank">follow me on LinkedIn</a> as I look forward to identifying and sharing new innovations that enter the market and continue to disrupt Last Mile Delivery. We will have some new product announcements of our own in the coming weeks. It&rsquo;s an exciting time for sure!</p>
