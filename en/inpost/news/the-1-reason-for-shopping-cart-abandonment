<div class="prose" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>The Number 1 Reason for Shopping Cart Abandonment&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Isn&rsquo;t tied to Pre-Purchase Dissonance caused by an inner conflict that the online shopper (consumer) experiences when they are about to make a product purchase,</li>
<li>It has nothing to do with the fear of experiencing buyer&rsquo;s remorse or the even more uncomfortable feeling of thinking that you could be getting a better deal somewhere else and going back and forth in your head about where to spend your hard earned money, and</li>
<li>It isn&rsquo;t the hesitation of clicking or tapping the &lsquo;confirm order&rsquo; button and setting that order process in motion &ndash; hey, we click and tap things on our notebook screens, tablets or mobile phones all day (and night) long! and it&rsquo;s pretty much second nature to us.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So what is The Number 1 Reason for Shopping Cart Abandonment?</strong></p>
<p><span class="underline">Shipping Costs and Limited Delivery Options, That's what!</span></p>
<p>Are you surprised? Not convinced? Disagree? Let&rsquo;s explore a little further to understand why.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by comparing the in-store versus online shopping experience, because the online shopper is being asked to exhibit a behavior that is quite different than that of traditional offline shopping.</p>
<p>When you buy a product at the store, the Retailer processes your payment and you go home with the goods you just paid for. You feel secure in the fact that if you change your mind or the product is defective that you can bring it right back and return it for a refund, no questions asked. That&rsquo;s comforting. It&rsquo;s an immediate exchange. There is a sense of protection that goes along with it.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at the online shopping experience. You go online, you find what you want and select it, add it to the shopping cart, pay for the product by providing the eTailer with your payment details, select a shipping option and then wait to receive your order. Most eTailers do not officially withdraw the funds until the product has shipped, but in your mind, the sale is done which is quite a different experience and it&rsquo;s significant. What makes it significant is that you are left to choose where you are going to receive your shipment, track your shipment, wonder when you are going to receive it, and if you will actually get it at all. Furthermore, when you do indeed get the shipment, will you actually want what you purchased or will the product be defective, which begs the question, of how are you now going to return it? Now you have this entire stream of thought running around in your head because of one online purchase. It&rsquo;s unsettling and it can only be remedied by one thing &ndash; <strong>convenience and cost</strong>.</p>
<p>Has the eTailer provided you with convenient and low-cost options for your delivery? Have they made it clear to you as to how to conveniently return your purchase, should you want to? If they have not, then they have increased the chances that potential customers will indeed abandon the shopping cart and not see the order through. This is highly unfortunate; because it&rsquo;s not that the customer doesn&rsquo;t want the product and to complete the transaction. In fact, it&rsquo;s the opposite in that they&rsquo;ve committed to it because they added it to the Cart and are ready to transact and place the order! The research speaks for itself and some companies are starting to take notice. So much so that a recent research report by Accenture found that&hellip;</p>
<p class="center"><img class="left" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAjYAAAAJDI4NDViNjlkLWZlZTMtNGQzMi1iOGRhLWZjZWMwY2I5ZTZlOQ.png" width="262" height="264" /></p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Two-thirds (66 percent) of consumers have chosen between eTailers based on delivery options. Most alarming of all is the moment of decision, where dissatisfaction with delivery options causes 68 percent of instances where shopping carts are abandoned before orders are submitted. Selecting the right delivery partner has become a critical business decision for eTailers.&rdquo; - Note 1</em></strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, the acquisition by Retail Giant Wal-Mart of the leading e-Commerce company Jet.com opened up discussions about how they could improve the customer experience. Wal-Mart is obviously looking to grow their e-Commerce business, but in doing so they also know that they must be more flexible and provide the customer with options and convenience when it comes to how they receive their orders. In an article in Fortune.com following the acquisition, Jet.com CEO Marc Lore confirmed the importance of this, <strong><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both obsessed with saving people time and money, and we will do that together by offering a wider assortment, better prices, and more delivery and pickup options.&rdquo; - Note 2</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>eTailers who understand that it&rsquo;s not just about having unique products at compelling prices, but that they must provide &lsquo;peace of mind&rsquo; to the online shopper when it comes to actually receiving their online order are winning. Amazon.com didn&rsquo;t become the world&rsquo;s largest eTailer by accident. They are currently exploring and testing a wide range of delivery options (<em>including everything from drones, to parcel lockers and developing their own fleet of vehicles</em>) and have revolutionized the industry repeatedly dating back to the initial launch and continued development of the &lsquo;Amazon Prime&rsquo; membership program. They realize that in order to protect their top position and risk being disrupted that they must push the envelope by disrupting themselves and that includes innovation in shipping and delivery options; through the use of newer technologies, methods and networks to securely deliver orders to customers in an efficient and timely manner while offering them the choice of how they want that delivery made.</p>
<p>If you are an eTailer who wants to reduce Shopping Cart Abandonment and provide flexibility in your delivery options to win new customers and keep existing customers loyal longer, then here are some Tips on how you can evolve from where you are today.</p>
<p><strong>3 Tips to successfully reduce Shopping Cart Abandonment:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em> Explore your options&hellip; Postal Delivery is one option, there are also couriers, in-store pickup and postal lockers where the customer can conveniently pick up their delivery when they want, especially for those who are not home during normal delivery hours!</em></li>
<li><em>Make them available to your customer by featuring them on website FAQ&rsquo;s or other areas. If the customer knows (while online shopping) that they have options, then they will be even more eager to transact!</em></li>
<li><em>Communicate it as a competitive advantage. If you have several delivery options, then be sure to message that because chances are your competitors don&rsquo;t and it can be leveraged as a dramatic difference for your online store.</em></li>
</ol>
