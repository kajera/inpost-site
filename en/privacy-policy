<p><strong>InPost Canada Inc. Privacy Policy:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>At InPost Canada Inc. we respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and explains data collection and use practices for the InPost Canada Inc. By accessing the InPost Canada Inc., you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy. We promise that we will use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What information are we collecting and how are we collecting it:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>What personal information do we collect?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever InPost Canada Inc. collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy. We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. The personal information we collect may, based on the operational need to provide the service(s) you have requested, include your name, title, company or organization name, e-mail address, phone number, work or home address, information about your job function, information about your company, and credit card information. We may request your e- mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a contest or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to announcement lists). Participation in contests or other promotions conducted by InPost Canada Inc. is completely voluntary and you have a choice as to whether you disclose personal information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as postal code).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are purchasing services from InPost Canada Inc., we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. Credit card and e-mail information will not be shared or sold to third parties for any purpose except as provided in this Privacy Policy without your express permission. InPost Canada Inc. also may offer access to some services that require registration. We may use your registration contact information to send notification to you of products and services by e-mail and/or postal mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new products and services. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive postal mailings from InPost Canada Inc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will we disclose the information we collect to outside third parties:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>InPost Canada, Inc. will disclose personal information and/or an IP address:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) To contact you regarding other products and services which may be of interest to you. At any time, however, you may opt out of such contact;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) When required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Cooperate with the lawful investigations of alleged unlawful activities, or to comply with any legal required of InPost Canada Inc. by a court of competent jurisdiction;&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) Protect and defend the rights or property of the InPost Canada Inc. network of sites and related properties, or visitors to the InPost Canada network of sites and related properties; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Fulfill a user's order or request;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) To process and fulfill your order or notify you of order status;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) When we have your consent to share the information;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) When you use co-branded services within our network of sites, you grant us permission to pass your registration information back to that service partner. Their use of your information is subject to their applicable privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent or as permitted by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What else should you know about my privacy when online?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The InPost Canada Inc. network contains many hyperlinks to third party Web sites. The InPost Canada Inc. network may also contain advertisements of third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>InPost Canada Inc. may use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you based on information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our websites in order to provide targeted advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you while visiting other websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The InPost Canada Inc. network may contain hyperlinks to third party websites. The InPost Canada Inc. network may also contain advertisements of third parties. InPost Canada, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party websites or advertisers. InPost Canada, Inc. does not share any of the individual personal information you provide InPost Canada Inc. with the third parties to which InPost Canada, Inc. links, except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although InPost Canada, Inc. may share general, aggregate data which does not identify individual people, with such third parties. Please check with those websites to determine their privacy policy. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain InPost Canada Inc. media properties may use a shopping cart feature that safeguards this information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other InPost Canada Inc. media properties may not use SSL and thereby do not offer a secure coded way to transfer information. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for&nbsp;maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your Consent To This Agreement:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>By using the InPost Canada Inc. network, you consent to the collection and use of information by InPost Canada Inc. as specified above. We reserve the right to modify this Policy. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.&nbsp;</p>
