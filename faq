                                                The parcel lockers are very secure. They are located in areas that are well lit, are busy with shoppers and also have security cameras record delivery and collection activity. We provide your customers with a unique ‘one-time-only’ pick-up code for each individual pick-up. The system will confirm when the pick-up has been made by the customer and send confirmation back to you.</div>

                                                When the package arrives at the parcel locker, the customer will receive a text message and an e-mail with their access code and the location of the parcel locker. The access code can be a code or a 6 digit numerical code. A code is sent via text message (with a clickable link which shows the code) and an e-mail (as an attachment). Pickin up a parcel with a code takes only 7 seconds – simply scan the code at the collection parcel locker. Pickin up the parcel using a numerical code takes only few seconds more, just key in the code on the parcel locker screen. And of course your customer can pick up the parcel when it is convenient for them.</div>

                                                1) Electrically powered using the equivalent to power a computer. The electricity is provided by the host site but each of the parcel lockers also has a battery as back up should it be needed.
                                                <br/> 2) Voice interaction on parcel lockers, so the machine ‘welcomes’ your customers
                                                <br/> 3) Similar technology to a mobile for communication: mobile SIM cards are used, so very reliable.
                                                <br/> 4) Each parcel locker has about 54 individual lockers to make them economically viable which means that they are approx. 3 metres wide and 2.5metres high
                                                <br/> 5) We also have a Modular version which means we can vary the number of lockers depending on the site requirements
                                                <br/> 6) Modular parcel lockers can be extended by adding modules to a maximum of 200 boxes.
                                                <br/> 7) Both models are illuminated with LED lighting strips.
                                                <br/> 8) Two security cameras are mounted at both ends of the canopy and one in the centre console which record transactions on to a hard disk.
                                                <br/> 9) The parcel lockers can be anchored if required, otherwise they are set on concrete foundation.
                                                <br/> 10) Weighs about 2.5 tons when empty.
                                                <br/> 11) The sites are on multi-year contracts so this will allow your customers to have confidence in their long term reliability.
                                                <br/> The specifications are really quite thorough and of course they have been in operation in Poland for six years now, so we know they work very well.

The maximum allowable difference of surface level between the highest and the lowest points cannot exceed 8cm [3 inches]; this is the range of built-in adjustable feet. After set up, the parcel locker must be properly levelled.
                                                    <br/> If the surface beneath the machine is not hard, we would use concrete slabs. For a detailed description of the process, please go to Installing a parcel terminal.

                                                Our Locker to Locker service is a new shipping method for Canadians to send parcels. Instead of overpriced courier services, you can send a parcel from one InPost Parcel Locker to another. Just select the origin and destination InPost Parcel Locker, print the label, and drop off the parcel at the origin locker. InPost will then deliver the parcel to the other locker. As soon as the item arrives in your selected delivery locker your recipient will be notified via email and SMS that their delivery is waiting for them with pickup available 24/7! (Hint: we also allow you to “ship” your parcel to the same Locker compartment that you dropped it. Great for holding something securely at a convenient location to be picked up later.)</div>
